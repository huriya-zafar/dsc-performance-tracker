# dsc-performance-tracker
DSC Performance Tracker is a modern, frontend-only web application developed for my university’s Developer Students Club to track member performance through a task-based point system. It features an admin-managed dashboard, a public leaderboard, and a polished UI designed to support clarity, accountability, and effective student leadership.
