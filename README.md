# dsc-performance-tracker

DSC Performance Tracker is a modern, frontend-only web application developed specifically for my university’s **Developer Students Club Hamdard University (DSC)** to monitor, manage, and evaluate member performance in a transparent and structured way.

The system follows a **task-based plus/minus point model**, where points are manually updated by leadership after task completion. This allows the society to fairly assess individual contributions, identify active and at-risk members, and maintain accountability across all teams.

The application features an **admin-managed dashboard** for leadership roles (President, Director Internal Affairs, and Vice Director), along with a **public leaderboard** that can be viewed by all members without login. This design promotes transparency while keeping full control in the hands of society leadership.

The user interface is **modern, polished, and visually engaging**, with colors inspired by the **DSC logo and branding**, smooth animations, and clear visual indicators for performance status. The project is designed to support effective student leadership, clarity in decision-making, and a performance-driven culture within DSC.
